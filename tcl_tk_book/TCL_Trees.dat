This package defines a single associative array to hold the trees and their nodes.

$$ tree package naming convention - treat each associative array index as multiple fields separated by periods.

global variable :  Tree_InternalArray > has indices that are used for
1. internal housekeeping 
2. defining a node
3. defining a node's parent
4. defining a node's children
5. attaching key/values sets of data to a node
6. attaching key/value sets of data to entire tree


Tree_InternalArray(base) > this index contains a counter that id incremented each time a new tree is created. it is used to create unique identifiers for each tree

Tree_InternalArray(treeID.base) > index contains a counter that is incremented each time a new node is created. it is used to create a unique i
dentifiers for each node within a given tree.

treeID.nodeID > this node is set when a node is created and is used by the internal procs to confirm that a handle ref a valid node. it does not contain any useful data

treeID.nodeID.children > index contains a list of handles of the children for the node idnetified by treeID.nodeID

treeID.nodeID.parent > 

treeID.nodeID.node.key > allows nodes to be used as container objects. 

treeID.tree.Key > these indices attach data to the tree, instead of a single node. the data can be retrieved with any node hanble and Key

proc Nameing Conventions >>> start proc names intended for use within a package with an upperclass letter (eg Tree) and use lowercase letters to start the procs intended for external use (eg tree).
