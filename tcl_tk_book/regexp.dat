#### Regular expression matching rules:

** smallest part of a regex is an atom -- an atom may be:
a single char - x - will match the char x
a range of chars enclosed in brackets - [a-q] - will match any lowercAse letter b/w a and q (inclusive)
a period - . - will match any character
a caret - ^ - matches the begining of a string
a dollar sign - $ - matches the end of a string
a backslash sequence - \^ - inhibits treating *, & $, +, etc as special char and matches the exact char
a regex enclosed in paranthesis - ([Tt]cl) - will match that regex

** atoms can be cmbined into peices:
another atom - ab - matches if each atom matches in seq
an asterisk - a* - matches 0 or more occurences of the preceeding atom
a plus - a+ - matches 1 or more occurences of the preceeding atom
a question mark - [a-z]? - matches 0/1 occurence of the preceeding atom
another peice - [a-z]?[0-9] - matches a letter followed by 0/1 more letters, followed by a number

** peices can be combined into a regex
an atom - T - if the atom is matched, regex is true
a peice - [TtCcLl]* if the peice kis matched regex is true
multiple peices separted by | - ([Tt]cl)|([Tt]k) - if any peice matched, regex is true

** range -- consists of sq bracket enclosing
a set of chars - [tcl] - any letter within brackrt may match the target
two chars separated by a dash - [a-z]- define a range of chars that may match the target
a char preceeded by a caret, if the caret is the first letter in the range - [^,] - any char except the char after ^ may match the target
[^a-z] - any char except chars  b/w the two chars after the ^ may match the target

** a peice or atom can be enclosed within parenthesis and will be considered as a single atom

** regex commands will return the largest block of text that matches the regex.
A.+B : match any set if chars bounded by A and B  

[^\n]* : match zero or more chars that are not newline chars
